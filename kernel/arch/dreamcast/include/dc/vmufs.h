    \brief   Low-level VMU filesystem driver.
    \ingroup vfs_vmu

    The VMU filesystem driver mounts itself on /vmu of the VFS. Each memory card
    has its own subdirectory off of that directory (i.e, /vmu/a1 for slot 1 of
    the first controller). VMUs themselves have no subdirectories, so the driver
    itself is fairly simple.

    Files on a VMU must be multiples of 512 bytes in size, and should have a
    header attached so that they show up in the BIOS menu.

    vmu_dir_t::dirty should always be zero when written out to the VMU. What
    this lets us do, though, is conserve on flash writes. If you only want to
    modify one single file (which is the standard case) then re-writing all
    of the dir blocks is a big waste. Instead, you should set the dirty flag
    on the in-mem copy of the directory, and writing it back out will only
    flush the containing block back to the VMU, setting it back to zero
    in the process. Loaded blocks should always have zero here (though we
    enforce that in the code to make sure) so it will be non-dirty by
    default.
