/**
 * check - scrambled/unscrambled detection for Sega Dreamcast
 * binaries (1ST_READ.BIN), built on the real (de)scramble algorithm
 * (Fisher-Yates over 32-byte slices, seeded by the file size; see
 * scramble.h). Deterministic, validated by round-trip on real samples.
 *
 * Approach (validated empirically on dcload-ip loader.bin/1st_read.bin):
 *
 *   - Disassembling the file is a POOR decision signal: the SH-4 opcode
 *     space is dense (~90% "valid" even on pure noise), so the ratio of
 *     valid opcodes barely changes between the scrambled and linear
 *     versions, and not always in the expected direction.
 *
 *   - The reliable signal is the VARIANCE of the per-block (256 bytes)
 *     Shannon entropy. A linear file (code plus distinct data sections)
 *     has high block variance because its regions differ. Scrambling mixes
 *     those regions at the 32-byte slice level, which evens out the local
 *     statistics and lowers the variance. On dcload-ip, the variance rose
 *     by 51% after the real descramble.
 *
 *   - So the variance is computed on the file as-is AND on the output of
 *     the REAL dc_descramble_buffer() (deterministic, not a guess). If the
 *     variance rises clearly after descrambling, the file was scrambled.
 *
 * NOTE: only applies to raw .BIN files (not ELF).
